## Learning The Lesson

From the previous post that while we were struggling with our health issues. The bigger things to think about came across the world. One typical night, I received a phone call from my mother just like she would call for casual talk. But this call was different, her tone was more serious. In that conversation, I learned that my mother who lived far away from us was standing on the thread and needed some advice from her loved one.

After an hour of phone conversation, I felt blank and soon many questions and concerns were pouring on me. My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at the age of 69. She needed an operation to get rid of the lime size tumor in her intestine as soon as possible. Then the chemotherapy would be continued after that.

I sat down to talk with my husband about the plan to ensure my mother would suffer as little as possible. We needed to calm ourselves and move on to the next step for the best of her health.

'Natural healing or chemotherapy, a serious and challenge decision for modern life.'

Her poor condition helped us open our minds to look for alternative healing because we were concerned about her condition with her age and existing health issues and also the side effects of Chemo and drugs. So we took time to search for alternatives and natural healing and we found medicinal mushrooms .

> Mushrooms for cancer? how could it be?

That was in our minds in that stressful situation.

We were the same as everyone, mushrooms are only food, right? We never had any other idea other than this because we learned that mushrooms, were fungi and mold which that could kill us. We searched more on it and found many articles in Thai from Dr. Anon Auetragul online, a UN Mushroom expert. On his website, we gathered tons of information about medicinal mushrooms and can clarify how mushrooms could be medicine for human beings and for every life on this planet.
In the meantime we got information from people around us, many of their loved ones can live healthy by controlling their diet along with natural healing and without any Chemo. On the other side, we also saw many cases of Chemo side effects on cancer patients, including our neighbor. In the end, we felt more confident about our decision.

While my mom was in the process of getting into the operating room, we studied Dr.Anon's research website. We saw a clear picture of how medicinal mushrooms work with cancer, it's totally easy and so truly natural. It just boosts your immunity so your body can fight cancer cells. Is it that simple?

> YES, it's so simple.

So, I decided to try medicinal mushrooms, to see how it works with my mother. I asked her to go back in time when I lived with her for dietary control. She could recall many types of foods to take. Every time I called her, I could feel her voice gradually getting better and better. Her immunity regained back to even better than ever. Many people around also noticed that she looked stronger than a decade prior. All in all, she showed no sign of jet lag or other weaknesses like she always had after coming to visit us years later. That was another great moment for my lifetime to see her become stronger and be a better person from whatever lesson she will learn from her new life.

The good moment is coming to me, I said to myself. Then I started to look back at our own family again. Curtain opening, we were seeing more perspective of our life and health. There are more choices for us. We didn't need to walk inside the small beautiful cage anymore. My oldest son was our first priority at that time. But wait, there was one more important thing to do first, getting rid of Trash!

My husband and I spent one afternoon cleansing our home's stomach, the kitchen. We read every bottle and package's labels, making sure that nothing that harms us can be kept. This included all the medications inside the cabinet except one thing, 'pain killer'! It was the only bottle that my husband couldn't live without for a long time. Later on, he would be able to understand and get rid of them.
After we had cleansed our family's stomach, it was time for our oldest son. He tried the medicinal mushrooms and everyone was excited to see the result. Was it fabulous? Wrong !

We didn't get the result that we hoped for. Maybe he didn't take long enough? We were confused. Why did he still have eczema like before?
At the moment, my husband reminded me that we still have another form of medicinal mushrooms to try, the Liquid Mushrooms formula! Dr.Anon called them Medicinal Mushrooms Enzymes. It tasted just like vinegar with an earthy tone added. Both of them now try to dilute it with water and honey and drink it every morning. By the end of the second week, I asked my husband if he felt any noticeable difference. He looked down to his right leg. "Wow, my wound has less inflammation, no more swollen in the area.", he said. I rushed to my older son right after. He, too, had noticeably less inflammation on his whole body. The deep cut wounds-like on his fingers were getting better, that's what I could see. And that was the first time that we could see new hope for the family.
We kept taking the medicinal mushroom enzymes until it's gone from our stock. We then contacted Dr.Anon for the next shipment. He rejected our request. Instead, he asked us to go out to the forest or buy them online and make the enzymes ourselves at home. Now, I could see ourselves walking around the perimeter. There were lots of our scattered footsteps inside.

Next spring, my husband and I revised what has happened to our life for the past year. We gathered all the memories we could. Many things happened throughout the year, but our son's health was the most significant. Last winter was the first time in our older son's life that he stayed in school without 2-week sick leaves. Our older son no longer had to wake up in the middle of the night because of his breathing issue. And learning progress of our life and enzymes had been established.
